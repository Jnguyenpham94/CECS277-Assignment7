i did recursion using getShapes(input); didnt work bc i suspect arraylist keeps
getting created so all the indexes are like 0 again because the arraylist 
is new everytime i call getShapes

many many errors with the program, if ran without any changes is an infinite loop

if ran with the recusion of getShapes(input); gives errors where the method is called

current assignment 6 the composite allows each component to be a shape or a composite,

the composite is a list of shape

now he wants us to store a composite can be a list of shapes and composites 


Jonathan's log of stuff: Brought back the helper function---> doSubList

Square: Count = 1, Side = 1
Circle: Count = 2, Radius = 5
I am a Composite containing: 
Square: Count = 3, Side = 2
I am a Composite containing:
Square: Count = 4, Side = 3
End of Composite
Circle: Count = 5, Radius = 6
End of Composite
Square: Count = 6, Side = 3   <--------- WRONG OUTPUT Side = 4
I am a Composite containing:
Circle: Count = 7, Radius = 7
End of Composite
Circle: Count = 8, Radius = 8
I am a Composite containing:
I am a Composite containing:
Circle: Count = 9, Radius = 9
End of Composite
I am a Composite containing:
Circle: Count = 10, Radius = 9 <--------WRONG OUTPUT Radius = 10
End of Composite
End of Composite
Square: Count = 11, Side = 4 <--------WRONG OUTPUT Side = 5
