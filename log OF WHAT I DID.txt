i did recursion using getShapes(input); didnt work bc i suspect arraylist keeps
getting created so all the indexes are like 0 again because the arraylist 
is new everytime i call getShapes

many many errors with the program, if ran without any changes is an infinite loop

if ran with the recusion of getShapes(input); gives errors where the method is called

current assignment 6 the composite allows each component to be a shape or a composite,

the composite is a list of shape

now he wants us to store a composite can be a list of shapes and composites
